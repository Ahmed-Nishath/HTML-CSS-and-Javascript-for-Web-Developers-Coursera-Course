      <!--About me-->
      <p>
        Hi!. I'm Nishath. I currently working as a full stack developer at
        google. I was inspired a lot in the past about programming and digital
        marketing by online blogs about other leading tech Giants. So I became a
        computer scientist to achieve my goals and here I am. I currently live
        in Washington DC. I find problem solving and cloud based developments
        interesting and I constantly involve in these areas to gain more
        knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Tech era we live in, every thing around us getting closer while
        technology grow bigger. So it's important to learn about technology even
        you are a major in a field that is so irrelevant to IT field. Therefore
        I encourage every one to learn about Information Technology as much as
        possible.
